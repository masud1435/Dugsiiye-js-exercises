    <h3> do...while Loop</h3>
    <p>The do... <b>while</b> loop is similar to the <b>while</b> loop, but it will execute the block of code once before checking if the condition is true, and then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.</p>
    <h4>Syntax:</h4>
    <p>do { <br>
        // code to be executed <br>
    } while (condition);
</p>
